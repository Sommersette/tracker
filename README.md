#### _Simple survey  and information on programming languages, Version 1.0, 03.26.2017_

#### By _**Trevor Fast**_

## Description

Tracker is a simple web page written in HTML5.1, CSS3, & JavaScript. The survey guides the taker through a series of questions and directs them towards information on programming languages offered by Epicodus. It also provides video and other options in case programming is not for them.  This survey will redirect you to links that are not hosted by the same domain. At time of development and deployment they were known to be safe to visit.


### Set up the website by using this link: https://sommersette.github.io/tracker/. It requires a screen with input or a mouse/trackpad. Browser requirements are html5 and will not work on Internet Explorer. The required fields warning will not display on Safari at all. It will seem as if the page is broken when it is the browser. Requires a keyboard for typing form field input.

*Once the page loads, point and click/tap.
